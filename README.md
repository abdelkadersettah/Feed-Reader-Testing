# Project Overview

This is project given to me by Udacity for my NanoDegree course, using Jasmine to test if the javascript of the Feed Reader App is working properly.

## How to Run Appilcation

Download repositrory from <a href="https://github.com/Ul1ra/FeedReader">here.</a>
Then open the index.html file in a browser.

## Tests That Were Implemented

- Tests for allfeeds has been defined and that it is not empty
- Tests for allFeeds have a url and that the url is not empty
- Tests for allFeeds have a name and that the name is not empty
- if the Menu is hidden by Default, by searching for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks that the menu is hidden
- the menu appears or disappears when the menu button is clicked.
- Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a single '.entry' within the '.feed' container

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
